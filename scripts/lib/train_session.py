"""Training sessions for a Pi executable built with the Pi-Bolt runtime (no AOT yet).

The first starts the TUI, runs prompts that read files, renders markdown and code, and quits, while the runtime records which
functions run, in which order (BUN_BYTECODE_ORDER_OUT), and which regular expressions the program builds at run time
(BUN_JSC_aotRecordRegExpsPath). The order is what the executable is laid out by, so this session is the plain start and the
plain turn.

The second records regular expressions only, and is there to run as many of them as it can: an answer that uses every kind of
Markdown and a code block in every language Pi highlights (training.md), streamed in so that every partial state is rendered;
tool calls whose results the TUI renders (a file written, read with highlighting, edited into a diff, commands, errors); and
the editor's completions. A regular expression that is not recorded is not compiled into the executable, and runs interpreted.
Usage: train_session.py EXE ORDER_OUT REGEXPS_OUT"""
