# Working on the JangMan-J/pi fork

Read this before changing anything. Upstream's own rules in the repo root `AGENTS.md` still apply; this file adds the fork's branch discipline. If `.fork/` is missing, run `install-tests.sh --no-run` first.

## Layout

`main` mirrors `earendil-works/pi` and is never edited. Each fork change lives on exactly one owning branch. `next` is generated: the first branch in `.fork/branches` plus a `--no-ff` merge of each following branch, in file order. Nobody commits on `next`; `.fork/sync.sh` refuses to rebuild while such commits exist.

| Branch | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `feat/native-anthropic-oauth` | `packages/ai/src/api/anthropic-oauth/`, the hook in `anthropic-messages.ts`, `test/anthropic-oauth-payload.test.ts` |
| `feat/native-antigravity` | `packages/ai/src/api/antigravity/`, `antigravity-api.ts`, `antigravity-images.ts`, `providers/antigravity.ts`, `auth/oauth/antigravity.ts`, additions to `google-shared.ts`, `test/antigravity-*.test.ts` |
| `feat/native-meta` | `providers/meta.ts`, the Meta branches in `api/openai-responses.ts`, the Meta section of `scripts/generate-models.ts`, `test/meta-oauth.test.ts` |
| `feat/native-openai` | `api/openai-codex-responses.ts`, the OpenAI/Codex sections of `scripts/generate-models.ts`, the OpenAI context and mid-convo tests, the `end_turn` continuation in `packages/agent/src/agent-loop.ts` |
| `fix/coding-agent` | `providers/generic-endpoint.ts`, `providers/openrouter*.ts`, `providers/README.md`, `packages/coding-agent/src/core/model-runtime.ts`, `model-config.ts`, the stationarity example, the `/codemode` command in `extensions/codemode/index.ts`, their tests |
| `feat/native-providers` | providers no other branch owns, such as Kimi Coding and xAI: `packages/ai/scripts/native-providers.ts` (catalog corrections such as the `kimi-for-coding` name and the unlisted `xai/grok-4.7-build-fast`) and its hooks in `scripts/generate-models.ts`, `mergeModels` in `packages/coding-agent/src/core/remote-catalog-provider.ts`, `test/native-providers-catalog.test.ts`, `test/remote-catalog-names.test.ts`. A provider that collects enough fork changes moves to its own branch |
| `fork-sync` | this directory (`.fork/`), `install-next.sh`, `install-tests.sh` |

`scripts/generate-models.ts` is touched by several branches. Edit only your provider's section, on that provider's branch. A change that spans two providers is two commits on two branches.

## Order of work

1. **Check state.** `.fork/sync.sh --status`. On a machine that has fallen behind (branches shown behind origin, `next` stale), run `.fork/sync.sh --align` first; it resets `main`, the branches and `next` to origin, but only where the local tip is already on an origin branch or tag, so nothing is lost. It tells you which branch you are on, whether each branch is rebased on `main`, and whether `next` is current, stale, or carries stray commits. Fix a dirty tree before anything else.
2. **Pick the owning branch** from the table and switch to it: `git checkout <branch>`. If you are on `next` or `main`, do not commit there.
3. **Bring the branch up to date**: `git fetch origin && git rebase origin/<branch>` (or `git reset --hard origin/<branch>` if you have no local commits on it).
4. **Make the change with its test.** Every wire change gets a payload-shape test in the branch's test file that pins the bytes. Where server behavior decides, run a live probe and record the sanitized result in the commit message. Run `.fork/check.sh focused`.
5. **Commit on the branch.** Commits are signed when the global git config sets `commit.gpgsign=true` and `user.signingkey` to a key GitHub knows (Jang's is `9B79F5EBD9E8D2E5`); `install-tests.sh` warns when signing is off. The pre-commit hook runs `npm run check`. `install-tests.sh` installs it with husky, because `npm ci --ignore-scripts` skips upstream's `prepare` step; if `git config core.hooksPath` prints nothing, run `npx husky` once. Use the upstream commit style, for example `fix(ai): …`.
6. **Rebuild `next`**: `.fork/sync.sh --rebuild-only`. It tags the old `next`, rebuilds it from the current tips, and runs the focused checks. Nothing is fetched or rebased.
7. **Push**: `.fork/sync.sh --rebuild-only --push`, or `git push --force-with-lease origin <branch> next`. `next` is always force-pushed because it is regenerated; the branches only when they were rebased.

To pull in new upstream commits, run `.fork/sync.sh` (full mode) instead of step 6. Order inside it is fixed: tag tips, fetch, fast-forward `main`, rebase every branch onto `main` in file order, rebuild `next`, check, optionally push. If a rebase stops on a conflict, resolve it, `git rebase --continue`, and re-run `.fork/sync.sh --offline`.

## Recovery

- Committed on `next` by mistake: `git checkout <owning branch> && git cherry-pick <sha>`, then `.fork/sync.sh --rebuild-only`.
- Need a previous state: every run leaves signed `pre-sync/<stamp>/<ref>` tags; the audit left `backup/*` tags. `git tag -l 'pre-sync/*'`.
- Branch not based on `main` after a manual change: `git rebase main <branch>`, then rebuild.

## Do not

- Commit on `main` or `next`.
- Edit `main`'s upstream files from a branch unless the change is the branch's purpose.
- Rewrite `next` by hand; always use `sync.sh`.
- Skip the payload test or the probe; "it reads right" closes nothing.
