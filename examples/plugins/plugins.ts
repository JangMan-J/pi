/**
 * Pi-Bolt plugin manifest: the extensions compiled into the executable.
 *
 * Build:  scripts/build-pi.sh --plugins examples/plugins/plugins.ts --out out/pi-bolt-plugins
 *
 * Each entry is an extension factory, `(pi: ExtensionAPI) => void | Promise<void>`, the default export of a Pi extension, or
 * `{ name, factory }` to give it a name in Pi's startup list and in errors. Everything this file imports is compiled ahead of
 * time with Pi, so these extensions start and run as machine code: no TypeScript compile at load, no interpreter.
